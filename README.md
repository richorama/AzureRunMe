# AzureRunMe 1.0.0.24

Probably the quickest way to get your legacy or third-party code
running on Windows Azure.

N.B. AzureRunMe has moved to
https://github.com/RobBlackwell/AzureRunMe

## Introduction

AzureRunMe is a boostrap program that provides an off-the-shelf CSPKG
file that you can upload to Windows Azure Compute and just run.

From there you can upload your code via ZIP files in Blob Storage and
kick off your processes in a repeatable way, just by changing
configuration.

If you are using Java, Clojure, C++ or other languages this might be
the quickest way to get your code running in Azure without having to
worry about building any .NET code.

## Background

There are a number of code samples that show how to run Java, Ruby,
Python etc on Windows Azure, but they all vary in approach and
complexity.  Everyone seems to write their own boostrap program. I
thought there ought to be a simplified, standardised way.

I wanted something simple that took a self contained ZIP file,
unpacked it and just executed a batch file.  All the role information
like ipaddress and port could be passed as environment variables
%IPAddress% or %Http% etc.

I wanted ZIP files to be stored in Blob storage to allow them to be
easily updated with all configuration settings in the Azure Service
Configuration file.

AzureRunMe was born, and to my very great suprise, is now being used
by a number of commercial organisations, hobbyists and even Microsoft
themselves!

## Example Scenarios

* A Tomcat hosted web application
* A JBOSS hosted app
* A legacy C / C++ application
* A Clojure / Compojure app
* A Common Lisp app
* A Delphi back end server
* A Ruby on Rails web app
* Use PortBridgeAgent to proxy some ports from an intranet server
  e.g. LDAP.
* Use PortBridge to proxy internal endpoints back to on premises
  e.g. JPDA to your Eclipse debugger


## Getting Started

Organise your project so that it can all run from under one directory
and has a batch file at the top level.

In my case, I have a directory called c:\foo. Under that I have copied
the Java Runtime JRE. I have my JAR files in a subdirectory called
test and a runme.bat above those that looks like this:

	cd test
	..\jre\bin\java -cp Test.jar;lib\* Test %http%

I can bring up a console window using cmd and change directory into
Foo

Then I can try things out locally by typing:

	C:>Foo> set http=8080
	C:>Foo> runme.bat

The application runs and serves a web page on port 8080.

I package the jre directory as jre.zip and the test directory along
with the runme.bat file together as dist.zip.

Having two ZIP files saves me time - I don't have to keep uploading
the JRE each time I change my Java application.

Upload the zip files to blob store. Create a container called
"packages" and put them in there. The easiest way to do this is via
Cerebrata Cloud Studio.

The next step is to build and deploy Azure RunMe ..

Load Azure RunMe in Visual Studio and build.

Change the ServiceConfiguration.cscfg file: 

Update DiagnosticsConnectionString with your Windows Azure Storage
account details so that AzureRunme can send trace information to
storage.

Update DataConnectionString with your Windows Azure Storage account
details so that AzureRunme can get ZIP files from Blob store.

By default, Packages is set to "packages\jre.zip;packages\dist.zip"
which means download and extract jre.zip then download and extract
dist.zip, before executing runme.bat (Specified as the Command
configuration setting.

Click on AzureRunMe and Publish your Azure package. Sign into the
[Windows Azure Developer Portal](http://windows.azure.com).

Right Click, Publish, Configure Remote Desktop Connection.

Deployment might take a few minutes .. patience is a virtue.

If all goes well your app should now be running in the cloud!

## Environment Variables

Before running your script, the following environment variables are
set up

* %IPAddress% to the IP Address of this instance.

All InputEndPoints are setup too, according to the CSDEF, something
like is:

* %http% the port corresponding to 80
* %telnet% the port corresponding to 23
* %http-alt% the port corresponding to 8080


## Compiling AzureRunMe

Prerequisites:

* Visual Studio 2012/2013
* The Windows Azure SDK for .NET version 2.2

## Diagnostics

By default, log files, event logs and some performance counters are
written to table storage using Windows Azure Diagnostics.  This is all
controlled from the diagnostics.wadcfg file.

I recommend Cerebrata's
[Windows Azure Diagostics Manager](http://www.cerebrata.com/products/AzureDiagnosticsManager/Default.aspx)
for viewing the output.

## Packages

You store your packages as a series of ZIP files in Azure Blob Store

The following config setting controls which files are extacted and in
which order.

		<Setting name="Packages" value="packages/jre.zip;packages/dist.zip" />

It's usually a good idea to separate your deployment up into several
packages so that you dont have large uploads everytime something
changes. Here is a recent example

	<Setting name="Packages" value="packages/jdk1.6.0_21.zip;packages/sed.zip;packages/portbridge.zip;packages/apache-tomcat-6.0.29.zip" />

## Commands

To run a single command, use a config like this

	<Setting name="Commands" value="runme.bat"/>

If you want to start multiple processes, you can specify them in a
semicolon separated list, like this

	<Setting name="Commands" value="portbridge.exe;tomcat.bat"/>

If you leave Commands blank and set DontExit, like this
	
	<Setting name="Commands" value=""/>
	<Setting name="DontExit" value="True" />

Then the instance boots up without running any code, but you can still
remote desktop in and start playing.

Optionally you can run some commands when the instance is starting
(i.e. via the OnStart method which runs before the load balancer is
directing traffic)

	<Setting name="OnStartCommands" value="start.bat" />

Optionally you can run some commands when the instance is stopped
(i.e. via the OnStop method)

	<Setting name="OnStopCommands" value="cleanup.bat"/>

## DefaultConnectionLimit

The default connection limit specifies the number of outbound TCP
connections.If your code makes a lot of outbound requests, you may
need to tweak this.

		<Setting name="DefaultConnectionLimit" value ="12"/>

## Configuration Keyword Expansions

Several of the configuration file settings support expansion of these variables

* $deploymentid$ expands to the deployment id - something like
  3bdbf69e94c645f1ab19f2e428eb05fe
* $roleinstanceid$ expands to the role instance id - something like
  {"WorkerRole_IN_0"}
* $computername$ expands to the computer NETBIOS name - something like
  RD00155D3A111A
* $guid$ expands to a new Globally Unique Identifier
* $now$ expands to DateTime.Now (the current time).
* $roleroot$" expands to the role root directory
* $approot$ expands to $roleroot$\approot
* $version$ expands to the AzureRunMe version e.g. 1.0.0.18

## Cloud Drives

Used to be supported but now removed as of 17/08/2013

## DontExit

If DontExit is set to True then the WorkerRole's Run Method wont exit
until the WorkerRole is explicitly stopped using OnStop.  If DontExit
is set to False then the WorkerRole's Run Method will exit as soon as
any processes created from the "Commands" section have exited.

	<Setting name="DontExit" value="True" />

## AlwaysInstallPackages

AlwaysInstallPackages True ensures that packages are always downloaded
and extracted from Blob Storage even if they have previously been
installed (This is the default and backwards compatible behaviour).

	<Setting name="AlwaysInstallPackages" value="True" />

Setting AlwaysInstall to False can optimise the time it takes to
restart an instance, by only reinstalling packages that have been
updated in Blob Store.


## Batch file tricks

It's common to kick off your processes from a batch file and its
idoimatic to call it runme.bat

It can contain all the old-fashioned DOS-like commands echo etc.

I often use

	SET

to display a list of all the environment variables.

Some useful variables include: 

	%ipaddress%  
	%computername%
	%deploymentid%
	%roleinstanceid%

I have a copy of SED (The Unix Stream editor) packaged in a ZIP, and
this allows me to perform simple file based configurations changes:

When I start tomcat, I do it like this rather than using the startup
script

	apache-tomcat\bin\catalina.bat run

Whilst the CMD shell doesnt really have proper job control, you can
start background processes with the START command.

## Issues

You may need to fiddle with your CSDEF file or use the portal if you
need more ports open.

The vmsize attribute is unfortunately, baked into the CSDEF file, so
specifiying a different instance size also needs a recompile.

When you RDP into AzureRunMe and start a web server from, say, a
command prompt it may be that you can only see it locally on the VM
and not via the load balancer. Not yet sure if this is an issue with
process context or firewall rules. Currrent work around is that you
must start your web server within a runme.bat or similar so that
AzureRunMe can start it as part of its Run method. UPDATE - I think
this is a firewall permissions issue - runme.bat runs as a USER, in
remote desktop you are an ADMINISTRATOR.

If you specify PreUpdate or PostUpdate commands and these block, then
your role might go unhealthy and the fabric might restart your
instance.
